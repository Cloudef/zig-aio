# CORO API

## IO

Inside a task it is possible to use the IO functions inside the `coro.io` namespace to perform cooperative
IO with the `Scheduler`. When calling a `coro.io` operation from a task, the task setups some internal state,
queues the IO operations for `Scheduler` and then yields, allowing other code to run in the program.

All the IO operations are merged into one `aio.Dynamic` instance for completion during the next scheduler tick.
While this may not be beneficial on all backends, the io_uring backend allows the kernel to execute all
the yielding tasks IO operations with a single syscall.

### Performing io operations

Performing operations is similar to `aio` module. The api is the same, but instead use the `coro.io` namespace.
Below is a full example of simple server / client program using the `coro` api. If `coro.io` functions are used
outside a task then the call would be equal to calling the equal function from the `aio` module.

```zig
// [!include ~/../examples/coro.zig]
```

### Cancellations

Use `aio.Cancel` operation to cancel the currently running operations in a task.
The `out_error` of such operation will then be set as `error.Canceled`.

Alternatively it's possible to call `task.cancel()`, or `task.complete(.cancel);` to actively cancel a task and collect its partial result.
