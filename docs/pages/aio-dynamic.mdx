# AIO API

## Dynamic IO

In case the amount of IO operations isn't known ahead of time the dynamic api can be used.

### Initializing Dynamic instance

Creating a Dynamic instance requires an allocator and upper bound for non-completed operations.
The instance allocates only during the `init`, and frees the memory during `deinit`.
Same allocator must be used in `deinit` that was used in `init`.

```zig
const max_operations = 32;
var work = try Dynamic.init(std.heap.page_allocator, max_operations);
defer work.deinit(std.heap.page_allocator);
```

### Queuing operations

It is possible to queue either single or multiple operations just like with the immediate api.
The call to queue is atomic, if the call fails, none of the operations will be actually queued.

```zig
// Multiple operations
try work.queue(.{
    aio.op(.read, .{...}, .soft),
    aio.op(.write, .{...}, .soft),
    aio.op(.fsync, .{...}, .unlinked),
}, {});

// Single operation
try work.queue(aio.op(.timeout, .{...}, .unlinked), {});
```

### Completing operations

It is possible to complete the operations either in blocking or non-blocking fashion.
The blocking mode will wait for at least one operation to complete.
The non-blocking always returns immediately even if no operations were completed.
The call to complete returns `aio.CompletionResult` containing the number of operations that were completed
and the number of errors that occured.

```zig
// blocks until at least 1 operation completes
const res = try work.complete(.blocking);
// returns immediately
const res = try work.complete(.nonblocking);
```

To complete all operations within the dynamic instance, use `completeAll`.
This blocks until all the operations are complete and returns the number of errors, if any.

```zig
const num_errors = try work.completeAll({});
```

### Handler

It is possible to pass `handler` to some `aio.Dynamic` functions. If done so, the `handler` can implement the following funcitons:
```zig
// Called whenever operation is queued in the Dynamic instance
aio_queue(self: *@This(), id: aio.Id, userdata: usize) void
// Called whenever operation completes
aio_complete(self: *@This(), id: aio.Id, userdata: usize, failed: bool) void
```
This is for example used by the `coro.Scheduler` to link IO operations into tasks.

If `handler` is `{}` (aka void), then the callback code is optimized out.
