# AIO API

## Operations

A handful of IO operations are supported.
All the pointer arguments in operations must remain stable until the operation has been completed.


`link` can be used to link the next operation into this operation.
When operations are linked, the next operation won't start until this operation has completed first.
`soft` link will propagate failure to next operations in the link chain.
`hard` link will not propagate failure, and the next operation starts normally.

### Common fields

Every operation supports these common fields.

```zig
out_id: ?*Id = null,
out_error: ?*Operation.Error = null,
userdata: usize = 0,
```

If `out_id` is set, the id of the operation will be stored into that address immediately after sucessful queue.
The `id` can then be used in future operations to refer to this operation.


If `out_error` is set, the error of the operation will be stored into that address, in case the operation failed.
If there was no failure a `error.Success` will be stored in that address.


`userdata` is not interpreted or modified any way, it can be used to link the operations to application specific context.

### Nop

Can be used to wakeup the backend, custom notifications, etc...

```zig
pub const Error = SharedError;
ident: usize,
```

### Fsync

Synchronizes the contents of a `file` onto the disk.

```zig
file: std.fs.File,
```

### ReadTty

Reads a tty device pointed by `file` into a `buffer`.
The amount of bytes read is stored in the location pointed by `out_read`.
If `mode.translation` is given a `TranslationState`, then the input on windows will be translated to VT sequences. (currently unimplemented)

```zig
tty: std.fs.File,
buffer: []u8,
out_read: *usize,
mode: Mode = .direct,
```

### Read

Reads a `file` into a `buffer` from a `offset`.
The amount of bytes read is stored in the location pointed by `out_read`.

```zig
file: std.fs.File,
buffer: []u8,
offset: u64 = 0,
out_read: *usize,
```

### Write

Writes contents of `buffer` from `offset` into a `file`.
The amount of bytes written is stored in the location pointed by `out_written`.

```zig
file: std.fs.File,
buffer: []const u8,
offset: u64 = 0,
out_written: ?*usize = null,
```

### Accept

See `man accept(2)`

```zig
socket: std.posix.socket_t,
addr: ?*std.posix.sockaddr = null,
inout_addrlen: ?*std.posix.socklen_t = null,
out_socket: *std.posix.socket_t,
```

### Connect

See `man connect(2)`

```zig
socket: std.posix.socket_t,
addr: *std.posix.sockaddr,
addrlen: std.posix.socklen_t,
```

### Recv

See `man recv(2)`

```zig
socket: std.posix.socket_t,
buffer: []u8,
out_read: *usize,
```

### Send

See `man send(2)`

```zig
socket: std.posix.socket_t,
buffer: []const u8,
out_written: ?*usize = null,
```

### RecvMsg

See `man recvmsg(2)`

```zig
socket: std.posix.socket_t,
out_msg: *posix.msghdr,
```

### SendMsg

See `man sendmsg(2)`

```zig
socket: std.posix.socket_t,
msg: *const posix.msghdr_const,
```

### Shutdown

See `man shutdown(2)`

```zig
socket: std.posix.socket_t,
how: std.posix.ShutdownHow,
```

### OpenAt

Opens `path` relative to a `dir`, opening is customized by `flags`.
The opened file is stored into the location pointed by `out_file`.

```zig
dir: std.fs.Dir,
path: [*:0]const u8,
flags: std.fs.File.OpenFlags = .{},
out_file: *std.fs.File,
```

### CloseFile

Closes a `file`.

```zig
file: std.fs.File,
```

### CloseDir

Closes a `dir`.

```zig
dir: std.fs.Dir,
```

### Timeout

Starts a timeout. Once the timeout expires the operation completes.
The timeout uses a monotonic clock source.

```zig
ns: i128,
```

### LinkTimeout

Timeout linked to a operation.
The operation before must have set `link` to either `soft` or `hard`.
If the operation finishes before the timeout, then the timeout will be canceled.
If the timeout finishes before the operation, then the operation will be canceled.

```zig
ns: i128,
```

### Cancel

Cancel existing operation referenced by `id`.

```zig
id: Id,
```

### RenameAt

Rename a `old_path` relative to `old_dir` into `new_path` relative to `new_dir`.

```zig
old_dir: std.fs.Dir,
old_path: [*:0]const u8,
new_dir: std.fs.Dir,
new_path: [*:0]const u8,
```

### UnlinkAt

Delete a file or directory locating in `path` relative to `dir`.

```zig
dir: std.fs.Dir,
path: [*:0]const u8,
```

### MkDirAt

Create directory relative to `dir` at `path`.
The `mode` parameter can specify the mode of the directory on supporting operating systems.

```zig
dir: std.fs.Dir,
path: [*:0]const u8,
mode: u32 = std.fs.Dir.default_mode,
```

### SymlinkAt

Create a symlink relative to `dir` at `link_path` linking to the `target`.

```zig
dir: std.fs.Dir,
target: [*:0]const u8,
link_path: [*:0]const u8,
```

### ChildExit

Waits for a child process to exit and collects its exit status.

```zig
child: std.process.Child.Id,
out_term: ?*std.process.Child.Term = null,
```

### Socket

See `man socket(2)`

```zig
/// std.posix.AF
domain: u32,
/// std.posix.SOCK
flags: u32,
/// std.posix.IPPROTO
protocol: u32,
out_socket: *std.posix.socket_t,
```

### CloseSocket

Closes a `socket`.

```zig
socket: std.posix.socket_t,
```

### NotifyEventSource

Notifies a event source.
Event sources have a Semaphore semantics, meaning there is a internal counter which is incremented by every notification.
The event source is signaled as ready until the counter is fully drained by either using `aio.WaitEventSource` or directly with
`source.wait()`.

```zig
source: *aio.EventSource,
```

### WaitEventSource

Waits for a event source to signal ready.
Event sources have a Semaphore semantics, meaning there is a internal counter which is incremented by every notification.
The event source is signaled as ready until the counter is fully drained by either using `aio.WaitEventSource` or directly with
`source.wait()`.

```zig
source: *aio.EventSource,
```

### CloseEventSource

Closes a event source. This is same as calling `source.deinit()`.

```zig
source: *aio.EventSource,
```
