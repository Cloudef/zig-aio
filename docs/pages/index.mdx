---

# Overview

zig-aio provides io_uring like asynchronous API and coroutine powered IO tasks for zig

```zig
// [!include ~/../examples/aio_immediate.zig]
```

## Features

- Blocking and asynchronous API
- Atomic operations
- Parallel execution
- Cancellation
- Timeouts
- Comes with a runtime and scheduler for coroutines
- Portable high precision timers compatible with `io_uring` `timeout`
- Tightly tied into `io_uring` by providing compatible API

## Support matrix

| OS      | AIO             | CORO            |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Linux   | io_uring, posix | x86_64, aarch64 |
| Windows | iocp            | x86_64, aarch64 |
| Darwin  | posix           | x86_64, aarch64 |
| *BSD    | posix           | x86_64, aarch64 |
| WASI    | posix           | ‚ùå              |

* io_uring AIO backend is very light wrapper, where all the code does is mostly error mapping
* iocp also maps quite well to the io_uring style API
* posix backend is for compatibility, it may not be very effecient
* WASI may eventually get coro support [Stack Switching Proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching/blob/main/proposals/stack-switching/Explainer.md))
