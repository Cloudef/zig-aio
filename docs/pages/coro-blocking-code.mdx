# CORO API

## Mixing blocking code

Sometimes it's not feasible to rewrite blocking code so that it plays nice with the `coro.Scheduler`.
In that kind of scenario it is possible to use `coro.ThreadPool` to allow tasks to yield until blocking code
finishes on a worker thread.

### Example

```zig
fn blockingCode() u32 {
    std.time.sleep(1 * std.time.ns_per_s);
    return 69;
}

fn task(pool: *ThreadPool) !void {
    const ret = try pool.yieldForCompletion(blockingCode, .{});
    try std.testing.expectEqual(69, ret);
}

var scheduler = try Scheduler.init(std.testing.allocator, .{});
defer scheduler.deinit();

var pool: ThreadPool = try ThreadPool.init(std.testing.allocator, .{});
defer pool.deinit(); // pool must always be destroyed before scheduler

_ = try scheduler.spawn(task, .{&pool}, .{});

// Or alternatively, which does the same as above
_ = try pool.spawnForCompletion(&scheduler, blockingCode, .{});

try scheduler.run(.wait);
```
